# springRestDataJpa
Restful API using Spring Rest &amp; Spring Data JPA &amp; H2 with Spring Boot
In this version which based from  the springRestDataJpa, I tried to improve the security side by using DTO 
when running the application, it's possible to open the :
  * h2 database : http://localhost:8083/h2 
  * postman for testing the rest services : http://localhost:8083/api/1.0/employees
